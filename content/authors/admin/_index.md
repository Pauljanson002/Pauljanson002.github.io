I am a masters (thesis) student at Concordia University and Mila Quebec AI Institute in Canada with a passion for computer vision and computer graphics research. I am specifically interested in using AI for 3D content creation and using it to positively impact the developers. I am also curious about continual learning and applying it to the current large scale models. I am being supervised by [Dr.Eugene Belilovsky](https://eugenium.github.io/) and [Dr.Tiberiu Popa](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~stpopa/). Before coming to Mila and Concordia , I worked as a research intern at KAUST in Vision CAIR group under the supervision of [Dr.Mohammed Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/). I did my undergraduate at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka with thesis in reconstructing 3D objects with few views with [Dr. Thanuja Ambegoda](https://thanujadax.github.io/).
