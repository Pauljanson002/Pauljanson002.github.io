My research interests include continual learning , zero shot learning , learning with limited data and domain generalization. I am working as a research intern at KAUST in Vision CAIR group under the supervision of [Dr.Mohammed Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/). I am also working on my undergraduate thesis  that focus of reconstructing 3D objects with single view with [Dr. Thanuja Ambegoda](https://thanujadax.github.io/). 

I am applying for graduate schools to start at Fall 2023.
