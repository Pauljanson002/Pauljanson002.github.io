I am a PhD student at Mila Quebec AI Institute and Concordia University in Canada with a passion for deep learning and computer vision research. My primary research interest lies in improving the efficiency of training foundation models by leveraging prior knowledge through continual learning, meta-learning, and model reuse. I am being supervised by [Dr.Eugene Belilovsky](https://eugenium.github.io/). Before coming to Mila and Concordia , I worked as a research intern at KAUST in Vision CAIR group under the supervision of [Dr.Mohammed Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/). I did my undergraduate at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka with thesis in reconstructing 3D objects with few views with [Dr. Thanuja Ambegoda](https://thanujadax.github.io/).
